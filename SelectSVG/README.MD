Steps to use the PCF in your PowerApps-Projects

If you have any questions feel free to contact me through YT-comments or via linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-rosengr%C3%BCn-ab35091b6/

I explain everything in detail in a YouTube-video, probably you should check that out as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jMQkVxKdoo
You can find the component as well at the PCF Gallery: https://pcf.gallery/select-svg/

The component is based on another component by Jens Christian SchrÃ¸der, which showed me how to load SVG code and get access to the different objects in the SVG code https://pcf.gallery/pcf-svg-control/

When you import the solution, you'll also find a Canvas App called "Select SVG demo" where you'll find some good examples how to use the component

1. Enable PCF-components in your environment in the Admin-center
2. Download the zip-file from the solution folder
3. Go to https://make.powerapps.com/ and navigate to "Solutions"
4. Select "Import" and choose the zip-file
5. In a Canvas App select Insert->Custom->Import component->Code->SelectSVG
   The component is now usable in the app but not yet on your screen
6. On the left navigation go to "Insert" (+ Icon directly underneath "Tree view")
7. Expand "Code components" and add "SelectSVG"

WARNING: The component doesn't work in your Canvas App Editor, but will work in the published version.

Properties of the component

svg_code: Here goes the SVG-code you want to display. Every object that you want to be selectable needs to have the class "selectableObject". 
          This can also be a group of ojects. You also need to set the id attribute to a freely chosen string.
          The component then returns the id attribute if you click on it.

use_fill: Expects the string "yes" or "no" (everything else the "yes" results in "no"). If "yes" it will override the fill attribute of every
          svg-object with the class "selectableObject"
          
fill_color: color used to override the unselected objects (if use_fill set to "yes")

selectedFill_color: color used to override the selected objects (if use_fill set to "yes")

svg_width: width of the image in pixels (set to Self.Width)

svg_height: width of the image in pixels (set to Self.Height)

selectedID: string can be used as input or output
           As input: selects the svg object with the corresponding id (best use would to put a variable in here that you can change in your app)
           As output: outputs the id of the selected object
